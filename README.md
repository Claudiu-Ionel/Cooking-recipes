# Quick Meals

## User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project.

**Quick meals** is a fictitious website meant to give its users information about recipes which are very easy to cook in 20 minutes. The site will be targeted towards foodies who want to have a quick snack and don't need to do a lot of groceries.

### Existing Features

- **Navigation bar**

  - Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Main page, Recipes dropdown menu, and Contact page and is identical everywhere in order to allow easy navigation.

## Technologies used

### HTML5

## Testing

I used Mozilla web developer tools and Chrome developer tools throughout the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues.

Website was tested across multiple virtual devices and browsers with the help of the developer tools. I checked all supported devices and all the features are behaving and showing according to the screen size.

I also tested the website on my personal hardware: Xiaomi 12 pro that runs on Android 13.

### Performance Testing

I used [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) tool to check performance of the website and these are the results.

The biggest issues where related to performance and it was because I wasn't using an optimal format for images. As a solution I converted all of the images into **WebP**.

### Validator Testing

- W3C CSS Validator to validate CSS
- W3C validator to validate HTML

## Deployment

The project was deployed on GitHub Pages.

To deploy a the project I had to:

- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the **Settings tab**.
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the **Deploy from branch**.
- From the branch section drop-down menu, select the **main** as the branch and **/(root)** as the folder and click **save**.
- After a couple of minutes the website will be deployed and you will find at the top of the page the link to your website. **(in case you don't see anything, refresh the page)**
